# Step 1:
### Create React App

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)  is a comfortable environment for  **learning React**, and is the best way to start building  **a new  [single-page](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#single-page-application)  application**  in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have  [Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6](https://nodejs.org/en/)  on your machine. To create a project, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
[Create React App Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```
